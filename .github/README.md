# Cool, why Gentoo?
[Read for yourself!](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Benefits_of_Gentoo)

If you don't like reading, ~~what are you doing here?~~ I like Gentoo
because of its community and its power through USE flags and patches
among other features within Portage.

# Why aren't you using real Gentoo?
[I wouldn't know why I would choose WSL either!](https://youtu.be/MShbP3OpASA?t=2996)

Obvious jab aside, I also think Windows is a good operating system
but bad for developer experience, which WSL fixes. I think I would
not be as comfortable as I am now on WSL as if I were on real Gentoo
Linux.

# Could you release your Windows dotfiles?
Maybe...
